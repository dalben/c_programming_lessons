You are in your home folder. Please check its path typing "pwd".

To list the files in this folder, use the command "ls" or "ls -l"
for a pretty output.

Each line produced by the "ls -l" command shows some info about the files.
If the first character is "d", this file is actually a folder.

In GNU/Linux, _everything_ is a file: a folder, a keyboard, a printer...

You can change to a folder by typing "cd foldername".

After doing that, type pwd again to check your current path and
"ls -l" to list the files inside that folder aswell.
