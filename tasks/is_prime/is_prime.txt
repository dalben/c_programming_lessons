Write a program that reads an integer N as input and outputs if it is a prime number or not. For example:

Input:
4

Output:
Not a prime number

Input:
17

Output:
A prime number!

Useful tips:
A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

The first prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73

In C, to verify if A is divisible by B, we write
if (A % B == 0)
