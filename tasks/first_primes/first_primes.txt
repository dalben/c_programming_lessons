Write a program that reads an integer N as input and outputs the first N prime numbers (2 is the first prime number). For example:

Input:
10

Output:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29

Input:
1

Output:

Useful tips
A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

The first prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73

In C, to verify if A is divisible by B, we write
if (A % B == 0)
