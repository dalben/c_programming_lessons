Here is your first contact with some C concepts. There are multiple C programs
in this folder. Please check them by typing "ls -l.

Each file has a prefix number, such as:
0_comments.c
1_printf.c
2_scanf.c
...
and so on. You shoud read, compile and execute them in order.

To read them, you can "cat" the file (e.g. "cat 0_comments.c") into the
terminal or open them with a text editor. We will be using nano for text
editing for now. To open a file with nano, type "nano filename".

To compile a C program, type "gcc your_c_file -o your_executable_file".
You can choose any name for your_executable_file.

Notice that if you do "ls -l" now, your executable file will have some "x"
markers in their permissions flag. This means this file contains inscrutions,
and you allow your computer to read and execute them.

To run a program, type its name prefixed with "./". This tells the system
to run the program. (e.g. "./my_program");

To rename a file, type "mv old_file new_file".

To remove a file, type "rm my_file".

To copy a file, type "cp original_file copied_file".
